E-Commerce Data Analysis


This project involves analyzing an E-commerce dataset to understand customer behavior, churn rates, and various patterns using Python's Pandas library.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform a detailed analysis of an E-commerce platform's customer data. The dataset includes variables such as CustomerID, Churn, Tenure, and PreferredLoginDevice, allowing us to explore key business insights such as customer retention, preferences, and usage trends.

Key Objectives:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing data, correct data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Descriptive Analysis: Understand basic patterns and trends, like customer churn, average tenure, and preferred login devices.
Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between key variables, such as Tenure vs Churn or PreferredLoginDevice vs Churn.
Multivariate Analysis: Understand interactions between multiple variables, like how Tenure, PreferredLoginDevice, and Churn are related.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is an E-commerce customer dataset that includes the following key variables:

CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer.
Churn: Whether the customer has churned (i.e., stopped using the service).
Tenure: How long the customer has been with the platform.
PreferredLoginDevice: The device most frequently used by the customer for logging in.
Data Cleaning Process:
Handle missing values (especially in the Tenure column).
Convert data types where necessary.
Ensure the dataset is ready for analysis by addressing any inconsistencies.
Analysis Performed
1. Descriptive Statistics:
Summary statistics for numerical variables such as Tenure and Churn.
Frequency counts for categorical variables like PreferredLoginDevice.
2. Bivariate Analysis:
Correlation Analysis: Correlation between numerical variables such as Tenure and Churn.
Grouped Statistics: Analyze the distribution of Tenure by PreferredLoginDevice.
Crosstabs: Relationships between Churn and PreferredLoginDevice.
3. Multivariate Analysis:
Heatmap: Correlation between multiple numerical variables.
Pivot Table: Summary of Tenure based on Churn and PreferredLoginDevice.
Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: To write and execute the analysis interactively.
Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior in the e-commerce sector, particularly focused on churn prediction and usage patterns. The findings can be used to improve customer retention strategies and enhance user engagement.
